HSQC
2D H-1/X correlation via double inept transfer using sensitivity improvement.
Phase sensitive using Echo/Antiecho-TPPI gradient selection with decoupling during acquisition.
Using trim pulses in inept transfer using shaped pulses for all 180degree pulses on f2 - channel
With gradients in back-inept and with suppression of COSY type artefacts
