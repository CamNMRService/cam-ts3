Standard 1H 400MHz BBFO "Smart" probe
DOSY 2D sequence WITH CONVECTION COMPENSATION
for diffusion measurement using stimulated echo and LED
with modified sequence for reduced lineshape distortions
D20=0.1s
P30=1000us - set as required up to max 1500us
gas flow=535l/h

Use first gradient amplitude =11  - otherwise artefacts in forst data point are likely
