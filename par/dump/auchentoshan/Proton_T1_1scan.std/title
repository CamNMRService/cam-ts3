Proton T1 measurement using inversion recovery with 1 scan per recovery delay
With broadband inversion pulse for perfect inversion and gradient pulse to remove need for phase cycling
With set D1 and vdlist, should be accurate for T1 up to ~10s.If necessary increase D1 and set TD(f1) to 8
to increase the maximum used recovery delay to 100s
Use getprosol to set pulses!
ns can be increased if S:N is not good enough but otherwise no need to use more than ns =1

For processing with dynamics center, select method "T1" and function "inversion recovery"
