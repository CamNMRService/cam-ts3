19F T1 measurement
Set O1P in centre of required 19F shift range, you can cover about 60 kHz  total (170ppm @400MHz, 140ppm @500MHz)

With broadband inversion pulse for perfect inversion and gradient pulse to remove need for phase cycling
With set D1 and vdlist, should be accurate for T1 up to ~10s.If necessary increase D1 and set TD(f1) to 8
to increase the maximum used recovery delay to 100s
Use getprosol to set pulses!
ns can be increased if S:N is not good enough but otherwise no need to use more than ns =1
Don't use RGA directly; either set rg to half the value from a normal fluorine spectrum, or acquire with XAUA
which will do faster rga followed by zg.

FOr processing, phase the last row to be positive; may need to do piecewise baseline correction 

For processing with dynamics center, select method "T1" and function "inversion recovery"
