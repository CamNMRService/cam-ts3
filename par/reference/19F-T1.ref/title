19F T1 measurement
Will cover about 300ppm or more with the Seedless_19F_excite and _inv pulses

With broadband excitation pulse, broadband and B1 compensated inversion pulse for ~perfect inversion and gradient pulse to remove need for phase cycling
With set D1 and vdlist, should be accurate for T1 up to ~10s.If necessary increase D1 and set TD(f1) to 8
to increase the maximum used recovery delay to 100s
Use getprosol to set pulses!
ns can be increased if S:N is not good enough but otherwise no need to use more than ns =1
Don't use RGA directly; either set rg to half the value from a normal fluorine spectrum, or acquire with XAUA
which will do faster rga followed by zg.

FOr processing, phase the last row to be positive; may need to do piecewise baseline correction 

For processing with dynamics center, select method "T1" and function "inversion recovery"
