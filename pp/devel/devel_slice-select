;;Experimental Description
;;A gradient pulse  is applied to the sample and a shaped pulse is applied.
;;at a frequency offset (SPOFFS1). The shaped pulse irradiates a bandwith (defined by cnst19) to select a range of frequencies.
;;This produces a 'slice' along the z-axis of the sample.
;;With GPZ1=50, cnst19=4000 at 400MHz, the sample can be imaged from spoffs1=-150,000 to +15,000 in 15,000 (approx 1mm) slices.
